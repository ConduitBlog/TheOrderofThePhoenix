    <h1>The Order of the Phoenix</h1>
    <p>
      We are the <strong>Order of the Phoenix</strong>. We are the last remnants of a forgotten world. A world where the greatest hero sacrificed her legacy to protect it. We were supposed to forget like everyone else, but with some miracle, we remember. However, someone has stolen the mantle of Phoenix
    </p>
    <p>
      We have no knowledge of who it is that holds the Pendant as of now, but we have seen him. He is young, Immature, unworthy.. He is not the one prophesied as the true wielder
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      The Pendant chooses the bearer, of whom is fortold. This imposter is not he. For the one called Amnest is the prophesied. She is the true bearer. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We are not villains, we are not terrorists; we are The Order of The Phoenix. And we will fix the incorrection in the timeline.
